 * (a) 'A'
 * (b) 0b1000001
 * (c) 0101

/*
 * After reading the chapter, I would expect (b) to be illegal because there
 * is no mention of creating binary numbers by beginning them with 0b, but
 * they all compiled without warning and gave the proper results.
 *
 * Upon further research, it seems that the 0b-binary is a gcc compiler
 * extension.
