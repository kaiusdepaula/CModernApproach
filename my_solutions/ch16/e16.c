/*
Which of the following statements about enumeration constants are true?
(a) An enumeration constant may represent any integer specified by the programmer.
True.

(b) Enumeration constants have exactly the same properties as constants created using
#define
False. The preprocessor is harder to debug and don't really leave traces in the program.

(c) Enumeration constants have the values 0. 1. 2,... by default.
True.

(d) All constants in an enumeration must have different values.
False. You can assign the same value to multiple enum members — they just need distinct names.

(e) Enumeration constants may be used as integers in expressions.
True.
