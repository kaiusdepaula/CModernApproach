/*
(a) Declare structure variables named cl. c2. and c3. each having members real and
imaginary of type double.
struct {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
}   c1 = {0.0, 1.0}, 
    c2 = {1.0, 0.0}, 
    c3;
(b) Modify the declaration in part (a) so that cl's members initially have the values 0.0 and
1.0, while c2's members are 1.0 and 0.0 initially. (c3 is not initialized.)
struct {
    double real;
    double imaginary;
}   c1 = {0.0, 1.0}, 
    c2 = {1.0, 0.0}, 
    c3;
(c) Write statements that copy the members of c2 into cl. Can this be done in one state¬
ment, or does it require two?
Only one, as they are the same struct.
c2 = c1;

(d) Write statements that add the corresponding members of cl and c2, storing the result
in c3.
c3.real = c1.real + c2.real;
c3.imaginary = c1.imaginary + c2.imaginary;
