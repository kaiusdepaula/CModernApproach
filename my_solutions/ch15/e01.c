/*
Section 15.1 listed several advantages of dividing a program into multiple source files.
(a) Describe several other advantages.

Decoupling code, DRY (Don't repeat yourself) principles, readability, maintanability, scalability
independent compilation and easier collaboration between programmers.

(b) Describe some disadvantages.

The more .h and .o (or so and dll) a compiler has to manage, the more complex linking will be, requiring the use 
of a system builder to deal with complex cases. This will be a complex task by itself 
and will increment even more the development cycle with errors related to this stage of Software development.
