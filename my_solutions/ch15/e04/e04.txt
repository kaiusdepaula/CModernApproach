NOTE: As this chapter will now make use of different files,
I've decided to change a little bit the way I'm solving the exercises.

In order to fully experience what the author expects me to do, I'll 
use a combination of multiple header and c files and save the shell commands
I execute to always keep track of what I've done.

Assume that debug.h is a header file with the following contents:
#ifdef DEBUG
#define PRINT_DEBUG(n) printf("Value of " #n %d\n"< n)
#else
#define PRINT_DEBUG(n)
#endif
Let testdebug. c be the following source file:
#include <stdio.h>
#define DEBUG
#include "debug.h"
int main(void){
    int i = 1, j = 2, k *= 3;
    #ifdef DEBUG
        printf("Output if DEBUG is defined:\n");
    #else
        printf("Output if DEBUG is not defined:\n");
    #endif
    PRINT_DEBUG(i);
    PRINT_DEBUG(j) ;
    PRINT_DEBUG(k);
    PRINT_DEBUG(i + j);
    PRINT_DEBUG(2 * i + j - k);
    return 0;
}
(a) What is the output when the program is executed ?
A: 
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i1
Value of j2
Value of k3
Value of i + j3
Value of 2 * i + j - k1

(b) What is the output if the #defined directive is removed from testdebug.c?
A: 
Output if DEBUG is not defined:

(c) Explain why the output is different in pans (a) and (b).

A: When DEBUG is not defined, the #ifdef DEBUG portion of the debug header wont be compiled,
resulting on PRINT_DEBUG being defined as a blank expression which wont run.

(d) Is it necessary tor the DEBUG macro to be defined before debug.h is included in order
for PRINT_DEBUG to have the desired effect? Justify your answer.

A: No, we can pass debug using a compiler flag, such as the flag -D on GCC.
We can run the command gcc -DDEBUG -o ./program testdebug.c debug.h and
the resulting program will be the same as running a.

NOTE: I've added the debug.h header only for being thorough, there was no need of doing
this as the c program is including the header by itself.
